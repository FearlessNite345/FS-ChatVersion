# Changelog v1.1.0
- Added new chat commands: `/fire`, `/gfire`, and `/ad` to improve roleplay communication and announcements.  
- Introduced a new quote/reply feature allowing players to directly respond to specific chat messages, helping others nearby see who you’re replying to.  
- Added `Config.SuppressNonCommandMessages` to control whether non-command messages appear in chat. When true, only recognized commands (like `/me`, `/do`, `/leo`, `/gfire`, `/ad`) will be shown.  
- Added `Config.ShowPlayerJoinLeave` to toggle whether player join and leave messages are displayed in chat.
